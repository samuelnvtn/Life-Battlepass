Life Battlepass aims to gamify life and everyday tasks in a whole new way. Its goal is to create a new generation To-Do list which is expanded by Challenges, XPs and Rewards for completing your tasks. Once this goal is completed, the Life Battlepass could be expanded once again with the implementation of Habit Tracker and other features. The ultimate goal is to become an amazing productivity platform for gamers.

## Battle Pass

Linear list of Rewards which can be unlocked by completing Tasks and earning XPs, but more on that later. Should be custom, sensible and fun things we tend to like and enjoy. Varying from videogames to beer or whatever we like.

## Switcher

Every Operation is a time limited event with a special theme, goals and tasks. That means something like Switcher will let us view history of our goals, tasks and productivity from previous Operations. Enabling Operation should pin it to our homepage.

## Challenges

Challenges are basically just a To-Do list full of tasks. Could be divided to Daily and Weekly. Every Challenge has its XPs calculated based on its priority and difficulty.

## Career Rank

Career Ranks are another fun way of tracking our productivity levels, again heavily inspired by Halo franchise. Career Ranks are earned by completing Challenges. They can earn us some rewards but don't have to. Ranks system exceeds individual Operations.
