Life Battlepass aims to gamify life and everyday tasks in a whole new way. Its goal is to create a new generation To-Do list which is expanded by Challenges, XPs and Rewards for completing your tasks. Once this goal is completed, the Life Battlepass could be expanded once again with the implementation of Habit Tracker and other features. The ultimate goal is to become an amazing productivity platform for gamers.

Challenges are basically just a To-Do list full of tasks. Could be divided to Daily and Weekly. Every Challenge has its XPs calculated based on its priority and difficulty.
